###  A Smarter Way to Browse – Block Ads & Learn About Privacy  

Tired of annoying ads following you around? Wondering who’s tracking your online moves? **Ethical Ad Blocker + Privacy Educator** is here to help! This Chrome extension not only blocks intrusive ads and trackers but also teaches you how to protect your online privacy.  

## 🌟 **Why This Extension?**  
Most ad blockers just remove ads. We take it a step further by educating users about **how** and **why** they are being tracked. Think of it as an ad blocker with a built-in privacy awareness tool.  

## 🛠 **Features**  
✅ **Blocks intrusive ads** – No more distractions, just a clean browsing experience.  
✅ **Stops online trackers** – Keeps your data safe from sneaky advertisers.  
✅ **Privacy insights** – Get simple explanations about online tracking.  
✅ **Lightweight & fast** – Won't slow down your browser.  
✅ **Easy to use** – One-click activation, no complicated settings.  

## 🎯 **How It Works**  
1. **Install the extension** from the Chrome Web Store (or manually if testing).  
2. **Browse normally** – The extension works in the background, blocking ads and trackers.  
3. **Learn as you go** – Whenever a tracker is blocked, you’ll get privacy tips inside the extension popup.  

## 🖥 **Installation**  
1. Clone this repo to your local machine:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ShahanaKV/ethical-ad-blocker.git
   ```
2. Open **Chrome** and go to `chrome://extensions/`.  
3. Turn on **Developer mode** (toggle in the top right).  
4. Click **"Load unpacked"** and select the project folder.  
5. Done! The extension is now active. 🎉  

## 💡 **Why This Matters**  
Ads aren’t just annoying—they track you across the web. Many websites sell your data without your knowledge. This extension helps you take control of your privacy while educating you on how to stay safe online.
